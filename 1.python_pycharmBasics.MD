The purpose of this session is to become familiar with pycharm and python.  

### TASKS ### 
Go through this list and get as far down the list as possible. We will then have a workshop to cover any doubts or questions. 

You will need to know how to install libraries into your python instance. These are the basics you need: numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn. 

This is a good video on getting started with Pycharm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=56bPIGf4us0 also the second one is also good https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRGpvbhOhQs

This is a suitable video to give you some python basics - using pycharm. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqtD5dpn9C8
