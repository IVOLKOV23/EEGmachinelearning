The purpose of this session is to become familiar with basic machine learning methods.
This ebook is available through the UoM library which is very helpful - Machine learning, Zhi-Hua Zhou (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007%2F978-981-15-1967-3). 
### Tasks ###
 * Read Ch 1 of Machine learning / Zhi-Hua Zhou
 * Look through https://scikit-learn.org/stable/

You will need to understand the different ML methods that are contained within scikit-learn. 
There are 3 types of problems which we will focus on:
 * Regression
 * Classification
 * Clustering

scikit-learn has multiple methods for each of these problem types. 

### Regression ###
Regression analysis refers to a predictive modelling problem where one or more continuous variables are predicted for a given example of input data.
One way to analyse eeg is to break it into each its bands and assess the power.  https://raphaelvallat.com/bandpower.html

### Classification ###
Classification refers to a predictive modeling problem where a class label is predicted for a given example of input data.
This page gives a good walk through of classification with scikit learn:

### Clustering ###
Clustering refers to a predictive modelling problem which seeks to group data with similar properties within close proximity in some feature/vector space.
