The purpose of this session is to become familiar with basic deep learning methods.
This ebook is available through the UoM library which is very helpful - Deep learning pipeline : building a deep learning model with TensorFlow / Hisham El-Amir, Mahmoud Hamdy 


### Optional Tasks ###
 * This is probably beyond the scope of SREP. However depending on the prior knowledge may be useful.
 * Fully connected networks (FCN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Autoencoders (AE), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long/Short Term Memory (LSTM), Transformers, Reinforcement Learning (RL) are all deep learning methods suited to differing problem types.  
 * Download and install tensorflow for your version of python.
 * If you have a GPU you can download and install the GPU version of tensorflow to increase processing speed significantly.
