	# Create a known signal so we can look at how bins impacts the reconstruction from FFT.
	# We want to have confidence that our FFT vector is truly representative of the underlying data.
	"""
	If we ahve 8192 samples for the FFT then we will have:	8192 samples/2=4096 FFT bins
	If our sampling rate is 10 kHz, then the Nyquist-Shannon sampling theorem says that our signal can contain frequency content up to 5 kHz. Then, our frequency bin resolution is:
	5 kHz/4096FFT binsâ‰ƒ1.22 Hz/bin
	Min Bin resolution is just fsamp/N, where fsamp is the input signal's sampling rate and N is the number of FFT points used (sample length).
	We can see from the above that to get smaller FFT bins we can either run a longer FFT (that is, take more samples at the same rate before running the FFT) or decrease our sampling rate.

	# We can use this analysis to determine what length of EEG we can use for FFT.
	# We have to trade of the number of bins (vector size) for lenth of EEG window.
	# Vector size is limited by processing hardware.
	# What is the longest EEG window for nbins = 1000 ?
	# This would mean we have 1000x2 inputs into the Artifical Neural Network (ANN). How bout nbins=500?
